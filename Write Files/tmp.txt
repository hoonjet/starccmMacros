- Revision required

1. As the author mentions, a high-pressure fuel supply system results in increased parasitic losses - please provide estimated loss (in terms of BTE or kW) when an ultra-high fuel pressure system is equipped.

2. The paper says that CO2 and CO were measured with an NDIR analyzer, but CO/CO2 emissions are not included in the paper; any reason for omitting CO/CO2 emissions? (Perhaps the trend was the same as HC emission?)

3. Figure 12 shows a few interesting points 

    - the PN emission does not change much when the fuel pressure changes from 400 bar to 1000 bar under cold start conditions (coolant temperature = 20 deg C), but it dramatically reduces when the fuel pressure was 1500 bar - although the author commented it for next research topics,2 orders of magnitude of PN reduction seems too important to leave it as "unclear". Any possible explanation (thoughts or guess) for this behavior?

- After the engine is warmed up (coolant temperature > 80 deg C), the PN emission increases as fuel pressure increases from 600 bar to 1500 bar. In addition, with 1500 bar fuel pressure, PN emission was the lowest when the coolant temperature was around 30 deg C? Do you have an explanation for these phenomena?

4. DMS 500 does not only provide PN emissions, but also information about PN spectrum. Do you have interesting results or insights for this?

5. Color bars in figure 14 and 15 does not have units - please add the proper unit



- Not mandatory(General comments & suggestion for future research)

1. DMS 500 MK2 offers a pretty good sampling resolution, although T10-90 is quite slow. With a proper gas sampling system, you can have quantified PN emissions during transient operation.

2. In Vehicle tests with the official protocol like FTP-75, the highest PN peak occurs during the first acceleration in the cold start phase (transition from cold start idle to 1800-2000 RPM and 8-10 bar IMEP within a few seconds). It can be another transient operating condition to work on.
